This is the official repository for the paper *"GUIPilot: A Consistency-based Mobile GUI Testing Approach for Detecting Application-specific Bugs"*, published at ISSTA 2025.

**GUIPilot** detects inconsistencies between mobile app designs and their implementations. It addresses two main types of inconsistencies: screen and process inconsistencies, using a combination of widget alignment and vision-language models. We’re continuously updating this repository. Stay tuned for more developments!

- Screen Inconsistency Detection:
    - Detects differences between the actual and expected UI appearance.
    - Converts the screen-matching problem into an optimizable widget alignment task.

- Process Inconsistency Detection:
    - Detects discrepancies between the actual and expected UI transitions after an action.
    - Translates natural language descriptions of transitions in mockups into stepwise actions (e.g., clicks, long-presses, text inputs).
    - Utilizes a vision-language model to infer actions on the real screen, ensuring that the expected transitions occur in the app.

## 📂 Structure

This repository contains three components:
1. The **core** module (`/guipilot`).
3. The **datasets** module (`/dataset`), which records the dataset repositories.
2. The **experiments** module (`/experiments`), which supports the research questions 1-4 as presented in the paper.

The core GUIPilot module is organized as follows:

- `/agent`: Handles the action completion using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) agent
- `/matcher`: Pairs widgets across two different screens for comparison
- `/checker`: Detects bounding box, color, and text inconsistencies between widget pairs
- `/entities`: Defines Process, Screen, Widget, and Inconsistency entities used throughout the module
- `/models`: Contains OCR and widget detection models

## ⚙️ Setup
### Setup GUIPilot

Clone the repository and follow the steps below:

1. Create a conda environment.
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate guipilot
    ```

2. Install guipilot as a Python package.
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

### Setup Experiments

Each directory within `/experiments` includes a `README.md` file that provides detailed instructions on setting up the environment, preparing datasets, and running the experiment.

## 🏃 Usage

Refer to [`/experiments/rq1_screen_inconsistency/main.py`](../experiments/rq1_screen_inconsistency/main.py) for a complete working example.

### Step 1: Load Screenshots as `Screen` Instances

Each `Screen` instance requires:

* an RGB screenshot (`numpy.ndarray`)
* a dictionary of widget ID → `Widget` instances (`dict[int, Widget]`)

You can either load widgets externally or use GUIPilot’s built-in widget detector.

#### Option 1: Load Widgets from JSON

```python
import cv2
import json
from guipilot.entities import Bbox, Widget, WidgetType, Screen

# Load screenshot images
screenA_image = cv2.imread(screenA_path)
screenB_image = cv2.imread(screenB_path)

# Load widgets from JSON file
# Example: [{"type": ..., "bbox": [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax}, ...]
def load_widgets(path):
    raw = json.load(open(path, encoding="utf-8"))
    return {
        id: Widget(type=WidgetType(item["type"]), bbox=Bbox(*item["bbox"]))
        for id, item in enumerate(raw)
    }

screenA = Screen(screenA_image, load_widgets(widgetsA_path))
screenB = Screen(screenB_image, load_widgets(widgetsB_path))
```

#### Option 2: Auto-detect Widgets with GUIPilot

```python
screenA = Screen(screenA_image)
screenB = Screen(screenB_image)

# Automatically detect widgets and run OCR
screenA.detect()
screenA.ocr()
screenB.detect()
screenB.ocr()
```

---

### Step 2: Run Widget Matching and Consistency Checking

```python
from guipilot.matcher import GUIPilotV2 as Matcher
from guipilot.checker import GVT as Checker

matcher = Matcher()
checker = Checker()

# Match widgets between the two screens
pairs, _, match_time = matcher.match(screenA, screenB)

# Identify widget-level inconsistencies
y_pred, check_time = checker.check(screenA, screenB, pairs)
```
